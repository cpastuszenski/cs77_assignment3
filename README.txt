Assignment 3 README


ABOUT:
	
	In Assignment 3, students implemented a simple OpenGL viewer with support for a variety
	of simple animation functions. These included animated transformation, skin deformation,
	and particle system animation.
	
BUILD NOTES:

	To build the project, simply type "make" in a terminal from the directory in which this
	README is located. To run the test program, type "sh render_all.sh" to run the shell
	script included in the framework that performs 6 separate animation tests.
	
	test04 demonstrates cloth animation.
	test05 and test06 are tests specifically built to demonstrate that rain and snow effects,
	respectively, can be displayed with the viewer.
